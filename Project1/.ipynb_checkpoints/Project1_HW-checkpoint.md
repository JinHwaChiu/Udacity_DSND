## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, there are questions I wnat to explore in stackoverflow survet at 2021   
1. What is population of codeing language at 2021 ?
2. How well can we predict the the frequency of visiting Stack Overflow? What variables correlate well with the frequency of visiting Stack Overflow ? 
3. How well can we predict the the frequency of participation in Q&amp;A on Stack Overflow?(ask, answer, vote for, or comment on questions.) What variables correlate well with the frequency of participation ?   


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available to demonstrate the analysis results for above questions.  In notebooks,  there are markdown cells, comment notes in code cells to assist reviewer to understand my thought process for each code cell.  
  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
